# Network Commands

A set of bash files to help identify information in a network.

## Purpose

I have a local Raspberry Pi at home that I use for local development and sometimes the IP address of it changes within my local network, when this happens I don't have a way to locate it without logging in to my router. 

In order to circumvent this long process I decided to log some of commands that could help determine and locate my Raspberry Pi on my network if this ever happened.

## Waiver

Note that some of these commands can be reveal sensitive information, please use these with caution and with good intensions. I take no responsibility in the use cases that these commands are applied in.
